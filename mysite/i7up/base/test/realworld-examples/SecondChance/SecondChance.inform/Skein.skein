As you stand up and brush yourself off, small dust clouds form. To the west is the front door, ornate and grand, but splintered and buckling after what appears to be decades of neglect. To the east is the foyer door leading further into the house. On the wall in front of you hangs a picture. Behind you there is a bookcase filled with dusty books. To get any more details, you'd have to take a closer look. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
